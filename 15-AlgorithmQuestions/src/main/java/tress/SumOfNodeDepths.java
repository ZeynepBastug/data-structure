/**
 * Problem: Sum of Node Depths
 *
 * The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth.
 * Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths.
 * Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child of node.
 * Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None/null;
 *           Sample Input                          Sample Output
 * Tree           =                                16
 *                1
 *              /   \                              The Depth of the node with value 2 is 1
 *            2      3                             The Depth of the node with value 3 in 1
 *          /  \    /  \                           The Depth of the node with value 4 is 2
 *        4     5  6    7                          The Depth of the node with value 5 in 2
 *       / \                                       Etc...
 *      8   9                                      Summing all of these depths yields 16
